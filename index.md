### Blog Post | Design Thinking

IBM’s office is covered in sticky notes. Little neon squares dot up and down the walls, working together to weave ideas into solutions. They’re scribbled with ideas that are innovative, courageous, and bold – the ones that question. 

observe <-> reflect <-> make

The Design Thinking process is a loop of reinvention. Its main goal is concerned with user experience: creating a framework to solve users’ problems at the speed and scale of a modern enterprise like IBM. The sticky notes give anyone a tactile way to Make: to give tangible form to abstract ideas and, in turn, convert intent into reality. These ideas begin with Observing the problem and trying to pin-down what others let loose: this is figuring out what’s important to the users, and then contrasting it against the user’s expectations. Bouncing in the middle between Observe and Make is Reflection; at first, this is the synthesis of what was gathered through observation. Observation becomes Reflection when teammates synthesize what was learned, and then come up with a plan of attack. 


### Blog Post | Recycling

New Orleans is known for its culture, spirit, and perpetual good time. Unfortunately, that good time often comes at a price: sometimes it’s a bar tab gone haywire or a flat tire from driving around the Quarter, but most of the time, we pay the price in glass. The City of New Orleans does not collect glass as part of their recycling program, though glass is ideal for recycling because no product is wasted or material degraded during the process. Most citizens of New Orleans have a difficult time finding a glass recycler, let alone one that’s in a convenient location. I’ve compiled four places to recycle glass in New Orleans and some extra tips about how to get more out of the recycle process.

1. **[Whole Foods Market on Broad St.](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/broadstreet) –** there are three Whole Foods in the New Orleans area, but this is the only one that accepts glass recycling. Located near the parking lot, there are also recycling stations for plastics 1-5 and 7, cardboard, paint, batteries, and other materials that are difficult to get rid of. Tip: the store awards ten cents off your purchase for every re-usable bag you use to pack your groceries. Located at 300 N. Broad St., New Orleans, LA 70119; open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week. (504) 434-3364.

2. **[Target Metairie on Veterans Blvd.](https://www.target.com/sl/metairie/1449) –** this Target accepts glass, but only if it is in reasonable condition—no broken glass is accepted. Located in Metairie, the trip requires a car or a bus if you’re travelling from anywhere within the New Orleans metropolitan area. Tip: use a Ride Share or carpool with friends to save money and fuel. Located at 4500 Veterans Memorial Blvd, Metairie, LA 70006; open from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. Monday through Saturday and from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sundays. (504) 888-2184.

3. **[City of New Orleans Recycling Drop-Off Center on Elysian Fields Ave.](https://www.nola.gov/sanitation/recycling/drop-off/)  –** while this recycling program allows for the most glass recycling at once (up to 50 lbs.), it is only open from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. the second Saturday of every month, and lines are usually long when they are accepting glass. Tip: they recycle Mardi Gras beads, too. Located at 2829 Elysian Fields Ave., New Orleans, LA 70122; check nola.gov/sanitation/recycling/drop-off for specific recycle dates. (504) 658-2299.

4. **Tulane University Glassblowing Center –** perfect for students looking to get some glass off their hands, this recycle center only accepts clear and green glass (no colors) and in smaller quantities. The drop-off location is by the Tulane gate entrance on West Road; a utility trailer is located by the Woldenberg Arts Center and glass is sorted into clear and green piles. Tip: this location is accessible at all times, making it a convenient drop-off place. Located at 6823 St. Charles Ave., New Orleans, LA 70118. (504) 865-5000.

Now, you may be thinking, “why are there only four places to recycle glass in the whole city?” New Orleans discontinued curbside glass recycling post-Katrina and all efforts to revive the program have failed. This means that there is not a market for glass recycling in New Orleans, and many of these drop-off locations contract sanitation companies to pick up glass and other recyclables. The nature of the situation makes it difficult for drop-off locations to accept glass at all times. Call ahead to confirm that any location listed above is currently accepting glass.

# The Catalog of Broken Things
### A. Molotkov


By Katherine Churchill | 94 pp. Airlie Press. 2016. Paper, $16.

“I am an hourglass,” he writes, in a form that tightens as it slides down the page: “most of me before	some after	almost none	in the narrow	now.” In his first collection of poetry, The Catalog of Broken Things, A. Molotkov, a Russian-born poet, musician, novelist, takes the reader for a surrealistic walk along the inside of a self-driven narrative. 

Molotkov abandons the framing power of the title and the tight formalism of structured poetic forms in favor of something looser; to be contained within a form is to be contained within a structure that doesn’t allow for the way that he communicates action, emotion, and character. Parts One and Three follow a loose poetic form that often mimics the rhythm of sounds and the image of shapes. Parts Two and Four run on prose forms that parallel each other; the simultaneous structure and looseness of the form allows Molotkov to intersperse the text with a form that visually widens and recedes:   

> In the final experiment, I’m the rabbit, and  
> you, the wheat field. I press my haunches  
> into your fertile soil, each leap eternal.  
> you are tender under me. You make many  
> sounds. The air smells of grass. Then you  
> are the eagle, your swoop smooth and  
> elegant, like a long parenthesis. I’m still  
> the rabbit.  

>  We study ourselves  
>  under bright lights.  
	
The subject of the poem suggests surprise, anger, a reaction—but the speaker doesn’t give in, and calmly decides that the circular roll of nature, of life, will continue. This seems to be the message of Part Two, strangely named “The Protagonist’s True Story.” Mostly written in the first person, these poems reveal the character of the speaker—but the poem also switches into a half-baked third-person omniscient point of view. It’s difficult to distinguish the purpose of the switch. The message is beautiful, certainly; however, the reader doesn’t become entrenched in this beauty, as they might want to, but becomes rather distracted by the cyclical nature of the form: this catalogue of images adds up to something, but what? The answer is not easily answerable, it seems, even in the looseness that prose form allows.

Part Four, titled “Your Life As It Is,” is weak for the same reasons as Part Two. It’s a collection of dreams written down in the hours of the early morning; every one begins with the opening line “you wake up in the morning,” and every one ends with the final stanza’s first line “you go outside.” The consistency of form is cohesive, though in reaching for a surrealistic style—trying to connect dream-experience with reality—Molotkov is caught in the same trap he fell into thirty-two pages earlier. The reader is again caught in a loop of the same message over and over, and no meaning is given to the repetition. To strengthen the message, maybe; perhaps to break the reader’s expectations of surrealism down into pieces—no obvious intention or method is discernable. 

The most cohesive part of the collection is the eponymous Part One, “The Catalog of Broken Things.” It’s an assemblage of portrait poems for different members of the speaker’s family. Mother, father, wife, husband, daughter, sister, aunt, and mother again are characterized through their relationship to the speaker. Consistent symbols of marble blocks, suns, wings, nets, and the sun and moon are used in parallel through different poems across the collection. A tender love poem, 2, characterizes the wife and the love between the two characters simultaneously:

> She undefines me,  
> sends me looking for myself  
> in new place.  

> I invite exile, love  
> invasion, mourn  
> her in advance.  

The speaker processes death from a young perspective in 8: “My grandmother is not / herself. / She has a room of dark fabric,” and punctuates this process by mimicking the rhythm of footsteps, “we listen for her / footsteps / when we can’t fall / asleep.” The focus on maternal figureheads rounds out the collection with a second poem about the speaker’s mother with a harshness that counterbalances the empathy of the first poem: 
 
> She knows suns  
> and moons fail in the end. Boats   
> sink, rot. Marble  
> crumbles. And now, I  
> know it too, I’m used to this  
> exit of others, this betrayal  
> of permanence.

If you’re looking for something life altering, The Catalog of Broken Things is not for you. Although he misses the mark in his use of surrealism, Molotkov invites the reader to see and feel alongside the speaker, where “veins have no traffic lights, no stop signs. Blood laughs at high speeds. Life boils our white cells, runs from the scene of the accident. We are the eggs of our future selves.”

# Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric
### Claudia Rankine

By Katherine Churchill | 155 pp. Graywolf Press. 2004. Paper, $14.

“IMH, The Inability to Maintain Hope,” she writes, an acronymic diminution for that “which translates into no innate trust in the supreme laws that govern us.” In her third book of poetry, “Don’t Let me Be Lonely,” Claudia Rankine takes the reader for a visual, spatial, auditory, and spiritual walk along the inside of the binding. The conversational, unexpected, and spontaneous—perhaps idiosyncratic—tone of her words conveys something about the experiences of the poet as a reactionary to the world around her. This world, of illness, of the American media, as affected by time and death, is a world that nurtures nihilism, disconnectedness, over-medication, and emptiness.

Rankine abandons the framing power of the title and the tight formalism of traditional poetic forms in favor of something looser; for Rankine, to be contained within a form is to be contained within a structure that doesn’t allow for the way that she communicates action, emotion, character—the simultaneous structure and looseness of poetic prose form allows her to intersperse the text with visual aids, as well as the freedom to reference complex context and content clearly, without the obscurity that formal prose form may nurture:   

> I ask my sister if she’s seen the commercial for   
> Diflucan, a new yeast-infection medication that is less    
> messy than the suppository Monistat. One rare but 
> possible side effect of Diflucan is liver damage. Monistat   
> is to suppository inconvenience as Diflucan is to pos-  
> sible liver damage—What is wrong with this picture?  

> I’m amused, but my sister is distracted because she has   
> been asked to assess the value of her dead children’s    
> lives…  

> Mostly we discuss what should...be included in the  
> portrait of her children’s lives…  
> Each activity is a sign, a sign that points to social  
> class, which points to potential worth. The private school,  
> the tennis lessons, the soccer team, the scuba medal...  
> were all headed somewhere.  

Rankine skillfully dismantles the severity of the content of this poem—another poem with no name, prefaced by the twelfth photo of a cathode-ray tube monitor—by cutting through it with the opening aside about suppository Monistat, and the conversational, analytical tone of the language used. The subject of the poem, the poet’s dead niece and nephew, suggests sadness, anger, a reaction—but she doesn’t give in, and calmly decides that the “somewhere” was a “place of compensation divorced from compassion.” 

“Don’t Let Me Be Lonely” also encapsulates the social experience of an America still recovering from 9/11—an America under George W., an America that asks: “to roll over or not to roll over that IRA? To have a new iMac or not to have it?”, an America that screams: “Now it is the twenty-first century and either you are with us or you are against us. Where is your flag?” She references an America whose hand is at the throat of the black man, under “Bush who can’t remember if two or three people were convicted for dragging a black man to his death in his home state of Texas…You don’t remember because you don’t care.”

She concludes her collection with meditations on poetry and its place in a new twenty-first century America:
	
> Or Paul Celan said that the poem was no different  
> from a handshake. I cannot see any basic difference  
> between a handshake and a poem—is how Rosemary  

> Waldrop translated his German. The handshake is our  
> decided ritual of both asserting (I am here) and hand-  
> ing over (here) a self to another. Hence the poem is  
> that—Here. I am here. This conflation of the solidarity  
> of presence with the offering of this same presence per-  
> haps has everything to do with being alive.  

The unfastened quality of form, the informal quality of tone, and the invaluable aid of image are the tools through which she establishes her reaction to the America affected by the dawn of the twenty-first century; she is reacting to a world that cultivates emptiness and nihilism through over-medication, death, injustice, and illness. Rankine invites the reader, through the gentleness of her form, to see and feel alongside her, where “in order for something to be handed over a hand must extend and a hand must receive. We must both be here in this world in this life in this place indicating the presence of.”

### Blog Post | The Pareto Principle

The Pareto Principle (otherwise known as the 80/20 rule) is a concept from Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who demonstrates that 20% of inputs create 80% of the result. The concept suggests that targeting two out of ten items, on any general to-do list, will turn out to be more effective than the other eight items put together. 

For example:

* 20% of the input creates 80% of the result
* 20% of the workers produce 80% of the result
* 20% of the customers create 80% of the revenue
* 20% of the bugs cause 80% of the crashes
* 20% of the features cause 80% of the usage

Remember, this isn’t a rigid mathematical rule, but more a concept about typical distributions. This principle is a corollary of the law of diminishing returns—as you get further along, the later actions won’t have as strong of an impact as the early ones. That’s why it’s often easier to get, say, a delivery center representative from 85% to 95% quality, but that final push to 98% is often the hardest. 

With this in mind, the Pareto chart is a basic data visualization to explain and support the idea that we should prioritize efforts in the areas they will have the most impact. Now, let's use one of our basic data pulls to create a Pareto chart to visualize an intuitive concept—that when creating a corrective action plan, we should focus on the 20% of error types that are creating 80% of the inconsistencies (i.e. the top error drivers).

Note: Keep in mind that the x-axis value is illustrative—really, any grouped root cause will work here. For example, if you went through and did a labeling analysis (and used consistent labels) you could also group through that as well to demonstrate edge case impact, auditor error impact, etc. 

![Image of Pareto Graph](/images/Picture1.png) 

This Pareto chart highlights what a quality team should focus on to solve for error trends and low consistency scores. For example, targeting first five issues would take care of half (50%) of the consistency drivers. You can use this information to justify your focus, request resources from management (and demonstrate the need), or to prioritize your own work.
