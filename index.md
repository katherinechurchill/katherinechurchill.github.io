### Blog Post | Design Thinking

IBM’s office is covered in sticky notes. Little neon squares dot up and down the walls, working together to weave ideas into solutions. They’re scribbled with drawings and notes intended to communicate ideas that are bold, innovative, and courageous– the ones that question the status quo and boldly ask how we can be better. Although design is often measured by its outcome or product, the act of design is actually hidden in the process.

#### The Loop

observe <-> reflect <-> make

The Design Thinking process is a loop of reinvention. Its main goal is concerned with user experience: creating a framework to solve users’ problems at the speed and scale of a modern enterprise like IBM. The sticky notes give anyone a tactile way to Make: to give tangible form to abstract ideas and, in turn, convert intent into reality. These ideas begin with Observing the problem and trying to pin-down what others let loose. This is figuring out what’s important to the users, and then contrasting it against the user’s expectations. Bouncing in the middle between Observe and Make is Reflection; at first, this is the synthesis of what was gathered through observation. Observation becomes Reflection when teammates synthesize what was learned, and then come up with a plan of attack. 

#### The Principles

Design Thinking vacillates between three principles. Restless reinvention reigns supreme in a world that is moving faster than it has ever before. Reworking everything or even starting from scratch empowers new methods and thought: we don’t get stuck on an old method or process, and constantly adopt new ones. The second principle, concerned with maintaining empowered and diverse teams, was established by empowered and diverse teams who understand the importance of generating varied ideas. The weightiest principle of the three is a focus on user outcomes as a measure of success – “did we fulfill our users’ needs?” – in the process of moving from idea to outcome. 

Design Thinking has the power to be the great equalizer. It offers a new start to old ideas and encourages failure to be a generator of audacity, boldness, courage, and a break-through.

### Blog Post | The Pareto Principle

The Pareto Principle (otherwise known as the 80/20 rule) is a concept from Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who demonstrates that 20% of inputs create 80% of the result. The concept suggests that targeting two out of ten items, on any general to-do list, will turn out to be more effective than the other eight items put together. 

For example:

* 20% of the input creates 80% of the result
* 20% of the workers produce 80% of the result
* 20% of the customers create 80% of the revenue
* 20% of the bugs cause 80% of the crashes
* 20% of the features cause 80% of the usage

Remember, this isn’t a rigid mathematical rule, but more a concept about typical distributions. This principle is a corollary of the law of diminishing returns—as you get further along, the later actions won’t have as strong of an impact as the early ones. That’s why it’s often easier to get, say, a delivery center representative from 85% to 95% quality, but that final push to 98% is often the hardest. 

With this in mind, the Pareto chart is a basic data visualization to explain and support the idea that we should prioritize efforts in the areas they will have the most impact. Now, let's use one of our basic data pulls to create a Pareto chart to visualize an intuitive concept—that when creating a corrective action plan, we should focus on the 20% of error types that are creating 80% of the inconsistencies (i.e. the top error drivers).

Note: Keep in mind that the x-axis value is illustrative—really, any grouped root cause will work here. For example, if you went through and did a labeling analysis (and used consistent labels) you could also group through that as well to demonstrate edge case impact, auditor error impact, etc.

This Pareto chart highlights what a professional team should focus on to solve for error trends and low consistency scores. For example, targeting first five issues would take care of half (50%) of the consistency drivers. You can use this information to justify focus, request resources from management (and demonstrate the need), or to prioritize your own work.

### Blog Post | Charter Schools in a Post-Katrina New Orleans

September 2, 2005: the day that water levels were at their peak after Hurricane Katrina hit the metropolitan area of New Orleans eight days earlier. Everyone took a hard hit from underneath the barrage of water—perhaps the biggest blow was administered to the already-failing New Orleans Public School District. Schools that stood for centuries were crippled by mildew and wood rot, and some were swept away altogether. The charter school model, lauded by psychologists and administrators as reward for result, was implemented as the public school system was auctioned and gutted. The effect has rippled out to every student in the New Orleans metropolitan area, but is this effect positive or negative? 

Charter schools are defined by publiccharters.org in their core belief: “public schools should be held accountable for student learning; in exchange for accountability, schools are given freedom to do whatever it takes to help students achieve.” They are open to all children, are tuition-free, and there are no special-entrance requirements. 

Legislation created the Recovery School District in 2003. It wasn’t created to take over the entirety of the public school sector in New Orleans, and they only operated four charter schools in the New Orleans metropolitan area pre-Katrina. After the disaster, the Louisiana legislature passed Act 35 on November 22, 2005, which granted the state of Louisiana to take over entire school districts if more than 30 of the schools within the district were “low-performance”—if they didn’t meet a specific set of criteria set up by the state. The New Orleans Independent School District fit into this criteria pre-Katrina, and so the state of Louisiana took over the district, calculated assets, and auctioned it off to the highest bidder: The New Orleans Recovery School District (RSD).

Some applaud the charter school model, which was first developed in the early 1990’s. Some will tell you that it was the best solution to the enormous problems facing New Orleans’ public education system even before Hurricane Katrina wasted the city. Some argue that the state mishandled the district auction and turnover, citing both ethical and financial reasons for the improper public to private handoff of the education sector that many believe should always remain public. Some don’t take issue with the shift from public-to-private, but see problems in the way that New Orleans charter schools are operating: some schools, like Lusher Charter School in Uptown require admissions tests, which allow them to pick-and-choose who is admitted. Charter schools don’t have to follow the same regulations that traditional public schools are subject to; some residents look into the impoverished communities of New Orleans and see charter schools that are too disciplinary. Some look at the charter schools in the same areas and see a staff of teachers that are too young, too inexperienced, and too white, leaving much of the youth in these predominantly black or mixed communities without black role models in their communities to look up to.

Charter schools are still under the hand of the state, where private schools are not, and have to answer to state tests. Most charter school students in the New Orleans area underperform on these state tests. Charter school performance or underperformance is complied into a number and a letter grade yearly, which is made up of performance on state tests, attendance, and dropout figures. These numbers are gathered, analyzed, and publicized under a collection of School Performance Scores in an Excel spreadsheet available to anybody with a mind to find it.

Below are short biographies of four students from different backgrounds attending three different charter schools in the New Orleans area, and some words on their experiences there.

Isabel is six years old. She was born on October 24, 2010 in the Touro Family Birthing Center on Foucher Street. She lives in a big white house on Nashville Avenue and attends the Lycée Français de la Nouvelle-Orléans, a small elementary charter school on Patton Street in Uptown. Her parents have hope that she will bridge the culture gap between them and their family in France.

Louis is twelve years old. He was born on November 19, 2005 in the Baton Rouge General Medical Center on Florida Boulevard, and was delivered by cesarean section when the doctors realized that he breached. His mother cried with him when they first met and then cried again when their house started to rot from water damage. His favorite thing to do is to play the snare drum, and he hopes to be in the marching band when he is older. He attends ARISE Academy on St. Claude Avenue in the Bywater. 
	
Kendall and Daniel are ten years old. They were born on February 2, 2007 at in the East Jefferson General Hospital. Their parents are Tracy and Sid, who both come from separate lineages of nineteenth-century immigration through the Port of Orleans, and who are also both civil engineers for the New Orleans Army Corps of Engineers. Sid was part of the debris pick-up team, one of the only groups of people let into the city after August 23. They both attend Lusher Charter School, an assessment-based entry charter school.  

Isabel, Louis, Kendall, and Daniel have lots of things in common, despite the big or small differences in their backgrounds: neighborhood, race, family, access to opportunities; the list could be endless if it’s allowed to be. They live in and love the same city, and the principal thing that all four have in common with each other is that they’re all receiving an education from the New Orleans Recovery School District, the first all-charter school district in the United States. 

ARISE Academy on St. Claude Avenue is located in the Bywater, the area of the city that was subject to the most flooding. The Academy is a charter school run under RSD’s jurisdiction. It received a D score (58.3) in the 2014 Louisiana Public/Charter School Report Card. ARISE was granted $825,000 by a privately funded foundation to take over Pride College Prepatory Academy, now called Mildred Osborne Charter School. This is something that locals take issue with as well: many schools in the New Orleans area, especially in disenfranchised communities, open and close quicker than they can mean something to the families in the community, and some argue that this creates a culture that is indifferent to the ways that education centers can bring communities together as they did pre-Katrina. 

The Lycée Français de la Nouvelle-Orléans is a small elementary charter school on Patton Street in Uptown. It has been lauded in the short number of years it’s been open as well-funded, well-organized, and well-administrated. It received a B score (91.5) in the 2014 Report Card. As a French immersion school, many parents send their children to the Lycée to connect them with the French culture of the city and perhaps of their families.

Lusher Charter School on Freret Street is renowned as being one of the best schools in the area, public or private. They received an A score (131.5) in the 2014 Report Card, the second highest score in the New Orleans area under Benjamin Franklin High School, a public magnet school not operating under RSD. Lusher was not always a charter school, and their application for charter was only accepted post-Katrina disaster. However, many criticize Lusher for their application process; many don’t consider it a true charter school because the administration does not admit all students. Prospective students take admission tests and are accepted based on their scores. The school is not obligated to release what is on the test. Understandably, many take issue with Lusher’s admission practices. Can they call themselves a charter school if they don’t offer free and open admission to any student? According to RSD, the administration, and the parents, they can, and they do. 

Unfortunately, though Isabel, Louis, Kendall, and Daniel all have their charter education in common, it’s become increasingly obvious that there are many factors to divide the system based on class, wealth, race, and opportunity. The Charter School model is not perfect; neither is the Charter School system in the New Orleans area, nor the New Orleans Recovery School District. How do we fix it? Ten years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans is slowly turning charter schools back into public schools, based on performance indicators like School Performance Scores. Some look at the Recovery School District as a permanent fix, while some look at it as a vehicle to “recovery”—back to a traditional public school model. With all of this in mind, it’s easy to lose sight of Isabel, Louis, Kendall, and Daniel: all very different but equally smart, important, and deserving children. We can only hope that they’re remembered on the winding road of New Orleans’ road to educational “recovery.”

### Blog Post | Recycling

New Orleans is known for its culture, spirit, and perpetual good time. Unfortunately, that good time often comes at a price: sometimes it’s a bar tab gone haywire or a flat tire from driving around the Quarter, but most of the time, we pay the price in glass. The City of New Orleans does not collect glass as part of their recycling program, though glass is ideal for recycling because no product is wasted or material degraded during the process. Most citizens of New Orleans have a difficult time finding a glass recycler, let alone one that’s in a convenient location. I’ve compiled four places to recycle glass in New Orleans and some extra tips about how to get more out of the recycle process.

1. **[Whole Foods Market on Broad St.](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/broadstreet) –** there are three Whole Foods in the New Orleans area, but this is the only one that accepts glass recycling. Located near the parking lot, there are also recycling stations for plastics 1-5 and 7, cardboard, paint, batteries, and other materials that are difficult to get rid of. Tip: the store awards ten cents off your purchase for every re-usable bag you use to pack your groceries. Located at 300 N. Broad St., New Orleans, LA 70119; open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week. (504) 434-3364.

2. **[Target Metairie on Veterans Blvd.](https://www.target.com/sl/metairie/1449) –** this Target accepts glass, but only if it is in reasonable condition—no broken glass is accepted. Located in Metairie, the trip requires a car or a bus if you’re travelling from anywhere within the New Orleans metropolitan area. Tip: use a Ride Share or carpool with friends to save money and fuel. Located at 4500 Veterans Memorial Blvd, Metairie, LA 70006; open from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. Monday through Saturday and from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sundays. (504) 888-2184.

3. **[City of New Orleans Recycling Drop-Off Center on Elysian Fields Ave.](https://www.nola.gov/sanitation/recycling/drop-off/)  –** while this recycling program allows for the most glass recycling at once (up to 50 lbs.), it is only open from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. the second Saturday of every month, and lines are usually long when they are accepting glass. Tip: they recycle Mardi Gras beads, too. Located at 2829 Elysian Fields Ave., New Orleans, LA 70122; check nola.gov/sanitation/recycling/drop-off for specific recycle dates. (504) 658-2299.

4. **Tulane University Glassblowing Center –** perfect for students looking to get some glass off their hands, this recycle center only accepts clear and green glass (no colors) and in smaller quantities. The drop-off location is by the Tulane gate entrance on West Road; a utility trailer is located by the Woldenberg Arts Center and glass is sorted into clear and green piles. Tip: this location is accessible at all times, making it a convenient drop-off place. Located at 6823 St. Charles Ave., New Orleans, LA 70118. (504) 865-5000.

Now, you may be thinking, “why are there only four places to recycle glass in the whole city?” New Orleans discontinued curbside glass recycling post-Katrina and all efforts to revive the program have failed. This means that there is not a market for glass recycling in New Orleans, and many of these drop-off locations contract sanitation companies to pick up glass and other recyclables. The nature of the situation makes it difficult for drop-off locations to accept glass at all times. Call ahead to confirm that any location listed above is currently accepting glass.

# The Catalog of Broken Things
### A. Molotkov


By Katherine Churchill | 94 pp. Airlie Press. 2016. Paper, $16. 
------------ | -------------
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Catalog-Broken-Things-Molotkov/dp/098957993X) | [Airlie Press](http://www.airliepress.org/the-catalog-of-broken-things)

“I am an hourglass,” he writes, in a form that tightens as it slides down the page: “most of me before	some after	almost none	in the narrow	now.” In his first collection of poetry, The Catalog of Broken Things, A. Molotkov, a Russian-born poet, musician, novelist, takes the reader for a surrealistic walk along the inside of a self-driven narrative. 

Molotkov abandons the framing power of the title and the tight formalism of structured poetic forms in favor of something looser; to be contained within a form is to be contained within a structure that doesn’t allow for the way that he communicates action, emotion, and character. Parts One and Three follow a loose poetic form that often mimics the rhythm of sounds and the image of shapes. Parts Two and Four run on prose forms that parallel each other; the simultaneous structure and looseness of the form allows Molotkov to intersperse the text with a form that visually widens and recedes:   

> In the final experiment, I’m the rabbit, and  
> you, the wheat field. I press my haunches  
> into your fertile soil, each leap eternal.  
> you are tender under me. You make many  
> sounds. The air smells of grass. Then you  
> are the eagle, your swoop smooth and  
> elegant, like a long parenthesis. I’m still  
> the rabbit.  

>  We study ourselves  
>  under bright lights.  
	
The subject of the poem suggests surprise, anger, a reaction—but the speaker doesn’t give in, and calmly decides that the circular roll of nature, of life, will continue. This seems to be the message of Part Two, strangely named “The Protagonist’s True Story.” Mostly written in the first person, these poems reveal the character of the speaker—but the poem also switches into a half-baked third-person omniscient point of view. It’s difficult to distinguish the purpose of the switch. The message is beautiful, certainly; however, the reader doesn’t become entrenched in this beauty, as they might want to, but becomes rather distracted by the cyclical nature of the form: this catalogue of images adds up to something, but what? The answer is not easily answerable, it seems, even in the looseness that prose form allows.

Part Four, titled “Your Life As It Is,” is weak for the same reasons as Part Two. It’s a collection of dreams written down in the hours of the early morning; every one begins with the opening line “you wake up in the morning,” and every one ends with the final stanza’s first line “you go outside.” The consistency of form is cohesive, though in reaching for a surrealistic style—trying to connect dream-experience with reality—Molotkov is caught in the same trap he fell into thirty-two pages earlier. The reader is again caught in a loop of the same message over and over, and no meaning is given to the repetition. To strengthen the message, maybe; perhaps to break the reader’s expectations of surrealism down into pieces—no obvious intention or method is discernable. 

The most cohesive part of the collection is the eponymous Part One, “The Catalog of Broken Things.” It’s an assemblage of portrait poems for different members of the speaker’s family. Mother, father, wife, husband, daughter, sister, aunt, and mother again are characterized through their relationship to the speaker. Consistent symbols of marble blocks, suns, wings, nets, and the sun and moon are used in parallel through different poems across the collection. A tender love poem, 2, characterizes the wife and the love between the two characters simultaneously:

> She undefines me,  
> sends me looking for myself  
> in new place.  

> I invite exile, love  
> invasion, mourn  
> her in advance.  

The speaker processes death from a young perspective in 8: “My grandmother is not / herself. / She has a room of dark fabric,” and punctuates this process by mimicking the rhythm of footsteps, “we listen for her / footsteps / when we can’t fall / asleep.” The focus on maternal figureheads rounds out the collection with a second poem about the speaker’s mother with a harshness that counterbalances the empathy of the first poem: 
 
> She knows suns  
> and moons fail in the end. Boats   
> sink, rot. Marble  
> crumbles. And now, I  
> know it too, I’m used to this  
> exit of others, this betrayal  
> of permanence.

If you’re looking for something life altering, The Catalog of Broken Things is not for you. Although he misses the mark in his use of surrealism, Molotkov invites the reader to see and feel alongside the speaker, where “veins have no traffic lights, no stop signs. Blood laughs at high speeds. Life boils our white cells, runs from the scene of the accident. We are the eggs of our future selves.”

# Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric
### Claudia Rankine

By Katherine Churchill | 155 pp. Graywolf Press. 2004. Paper, $14. 
------------ | -------------
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Let-Me-Be-Lonely/dp/1555974074) | [Graywolf Press](https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/dont-let-me-be-lonely)

“IMH, The Inability to Maintain Hope,” she writes, an acronymic diminution for that “which translates into no innate trust in the supreme laws that govern us.” In her third book of poetry, “Don’t Let me Be Lonely,” Claudia Rankine takes the reader for a visual, spatial, auditory, and spiritual walk along the inside of the binding. The conversational, unexpected, and spontaneous—perhaps idiosyncratic—tone of her words conveys something about the experiences of the poet as a reactionary to the world around her. This world, of illness, of the American media, as affected by time and death, is a world that nurtures nihilism, disconnectedness, over-medication, and emptiness.

Rankine abandons the framing power of the title and the tight formalism of traditional poetic forms in favor of something looser; for Rankine, to be contained within a form is to be contained within a structure that doesn’t allow for the way that she communicates action, emotion, character—the simultaneous structure and looseness of poetic prose form allows her to intersperse the text with visual aids, as well as the freedom to reference complex context and content clearly, without the obscurity that formal prose form may nurture:   

> I ask my sister if she’s seen the commercial for   
> Diflucan, a new yeast-infection medication that is less    
> messy than the suppository Monistat. One rare but 
> possible side effect of Diflucan is liver damage. Monistat   
> is to suppository inconvenience as Diflucan is to pos-  
> sible liver damage—What is wrong with this picture?  

> I’m amused, but my sister is distracted because she has   
> been asked to assess the value of her dead children’s    
> lives…  

> Mostly we discuss what should...be included in the  
> portrait of her children’s lives…  
> Each activity is a sign, a sign that points to social  
> class, which points to potential worth. The private school,  
> the tennis lessons, the soccer team, the scuba medal...  
> were all headed somewhere.  

Rankine skillfully dismantles the severity of the content of this poem—another poem with no name, prefaced by the twelfth photo of a cathode-ray tube monitor—by cutting through it with the opening aside about suppository Monistat, and the conversational, analytical tone of the language used. The subject of the poem, the poet’s dead niece and nephew, suggests sadness, anger, a reaction—but she doesn’t give in, and calmly decides that the “somewhere” was a “place of compensation divorced from compassion.” 

“Don’t Let Me Be Lonely” also encapsulates the social experience of an America still recovering from 9/11—an America under George W., an America that asks: “to roll over or not to roll over that IRA? To have a new iMac or not to have it?”, an America that screams: “Now it is the twenty-first century and either you are with us or you are against us. Where is your flag?” She references an America whose hand is at the throat of the black man, under “Bush who can’t remember if two or three people were convicted for dragging a black man to his death in his home state of Texas…You don’t remember because you don’t care.”

She concludes her collection with meditations on poetry and its place in a new twenty-first century America:
	
> Or Paul Celan said that the poem was no different  
> from a handshake. I cannot see any basic difference  
> between a handshake and a poem—is how Rosemary  

> Waldrop translated his German. The handshake is our  
> decided ritual of both asserting (I am here) and hand-  
> ing over (here) a self to another. Hence the poem is  
> that—Here. I am here. This conflation of the solidarity  
> of presence with the offering of this same presence per-  
> haps has everything to do with being alive.  

The unfastened quality of form, the informal quality of tone, and the invaluable aid of image are the tools through which she establishes her reaction to the America affected by the dawn of the twenty-first century; she is reacting to a world that cultivates emptiness and nihilism through over-medication, death, injustice, and illness. Rankine invites the reader, through the gentleness of her form, to see and feel alongside her, where “in order for something to be handed over a hand must extend and a hand must receive. We must both be here in this world in this life in this place indicating the presence of.”
