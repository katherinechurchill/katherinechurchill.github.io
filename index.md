# The Catalog of Broken Things
### By A. Molotkov

“I am an hourglass,” he writes, in a form that tightens as it slides down the page: “most of me before	some after	almost none	in the narrow	now.” In his first collection of poetry, The Catalog of Broken Things, A. Molotkov, a Russian-born poet, musician, novelist, takes the reader for a surrealistic walk along the inside of a self-driven narrative. 

Molotkov abandons the framing power of the title and the tight formalism of structured poetic forms in favor of something looser; to be contained within a form is to be contained within a structure that doesn’t allow for the way that he communicates action, emotion, and character. Parts One and Three follow a loose poetic form that often mimics the rhythm of sounds and the image of shapes. Parts Two and Four run on prose forms that parallel each other; the simultaneous structure and looseness of the form allows Molotkov to intersperse the text with a form that visually widens and recedes:   

> In the final experiment, I’m the rabbit, and /  
> you, the wheat field. I press my haunches /  
> into your fertile soil, each leap eternal. /  
> you are tender under me. You make many /  
> sounds. The air smells of grass. Then you /  
> are the eagle, your swoop smooth and /  
> elegant, like a long parenthesis. I’m still /  
> the rabbit. /  

>  We study ourselves /  
>  under bright lights. /  
	
The subject of the poem suggests surprise, anger, a reaction—but the speaker doesn’t give in, and calmly decides that the circular roll of nature, of life, will continue. This seems to be the message of Part Two, strangely named “The Protagonist’s True Story.” Mostly written in the first person, these poems reveal the character of the speaker—but the poem also switches into a half-baked third-person omniscient point of view. It’s difficult to distinguish the purpose of the switch. The message is beautiful, certainly; however, the reader doesn’t become entrenched in this beauty, as they might want to, but becomes rather distracted by the cyclical nature of the form: this catalogue of images adds up to something, but what? The answer is not easily answerable, it seems, even in the looseness that prose form allows.

Part Four, titled “Your Life As It Is,” is weak for the same reasons as Part Two. It’s a collection of dreams written down in the hours of the early morning; every one begins with the opening line “you wake up in the morning,” and every one ends with the final stanza’s first line “you go outside.” The consistency of form is cohesive, though in reaching for a surrealistic style—trying to connect dream-experience with reality—Molotkov is caught in the same trap he fell into thirty-two pages earlier. The reader is again caught in a loop of the same message over and over, and no meaning is given to the repetition. To strengthen the message, maybe; perhaps to break the reader’s expectations of surrealism down into pieces—no obvious intention or method is discernable. 

The most cohesive part of the collection is the eponymous Part One, “The Catalog of Broken Things.” It’s an assemblage of portrait poems for different members of the speaker’s family. Mother, father, wife, husband, daughter, sister, aunt, and mother again are characterized through their relationship to the speaker. Consistent symbols of marble blocks, suns, wings, nets, and the sun and moon are used in parallel through different poems across the collection. A tender love poem, 2, characterizes the wife and the love between the two characters simultaneously:

> She undefines me, /  
> sends me looking for myself /  
> in new place. / 

> I invite exile, love /  
> invasion, mourn /  
> her in advance. /  

The speaker processes death from a young perspective in 8: “My grandmother is not / herself. / She has a room of dark fabric,” and punctuates this process by mimicking the rhythm of footsteps, “we listen for her / footsteps / when we can’t fall / asleep.” The focus on maternal figureheads rounds out the collection with a second poem about the speaker’s mother with a harshness that counterbalances the empathy of the first poem: 
 
> She knows suns /  
> and moons fail in the end. Boats /  
> sink, rot. Marble /  
> crumbles. And now, I /  
> know it too, I’m used to this /  
> exit of others, this betrayal /  
> of permanence.

If you’re looking for something life altering, The Catalog of Broken Things is not for you. Although he misses the mark in his use of surrealism, Molotkov invites the reader to see and feel alongside the speaker, where “veins have no traffic lights, no stop signs. Blood laughs at high speeds. Life boils our white cells, runs from the scene of the accident. We are the eggs of our future selves.”

# Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric
### By Claudia Rankine

155 pp. Graywolf Press. 2004. Paper, $14. 

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Let-Me-Be-Lonely/dp/1555974074) | [Graywolf Press](https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/dont-let-me-be-lonely)

“IMH, The Inability to Maintain Hope,” she writes, an acronymic diminution for that “which translates into no innate trust in the supreme laws that govern us.” In her third book of poetry, “Don’t Let me Be Lonely,” Claudia Rankine takes the reader for a visual, spatial, auditory, and spiritual walk along the inside of the binding. The conversational, unexpected, and spontaneous—perhaps idiosyncratic—tone of her words conveys something about the experiences of the poet as a reactionary to the world around her. This world, of illness, of the American media, as affected by time and death, is a world that nurtures nihilism, disconnectedness, over-medication, and emptiness.

Rankine abandons the framing power of the title and the tight formalism of traditional poetic forms in favor of something looser; for Rankine, to be contained within a form is to be contained within a structure that doesn’t allow for the way that she communicates action, emotion, character—the simultaneous structure and looseness of poetic prose form allows her to intersperse the text with visual aids, as well as the freedom to reference complex context and content clearly, without the obscurity that formal prose form may nurture:   

> I ask my sister if she’s seen the commercial for /  
> Diflucan, a new yeast-infection medication that is less /   
> messy than the suppository Monistat. One rare but pos- /  
> sible side effect of Diflucan is liver damage. Monistat /  
> is to suppository inconvenience as Diflucan is to pos- /  
> sible liver damage—What is wrong with this picture? /  

> I’m amused, but my sister is distracted because she has /  
> been asked to assess the value of her dead children’s /  
> lives… /  

> Mostly we discuss what should...be included in the por- /  
> trait of her children’s lives… /  
> Each activity is a sign, a sign that points to social class, /  
> which points to potential worth. The private school, /  
> the tennis lessons, the soccer team, the scuba med- /  
> al…were all headed somewhere. /  

Rankine skillfully dismantles the severity of the content of this poem—another poem with no name, prefaced by the twelfth photo of a cathode-ray tube monitor—by cutting through it with the opening aside about suppository Monistat, and the conversational, analytical tone of the language used. The subject of the poem, the poet’s dead niece and nephew, suggests sadness, anger, a reaction—but she doesn’t give in, and calmly decides that the “somewhere” was a “place of compensation divorced from compassion.” 

“Don’t Let Me Be Lonely” also encapsulates the social experience of an America still recovering from 9/11—an America under George W., an America that asks: “to roll over or not to roll over that IRA? To have a new iMac or not to have it?”, an America that screams: “Now it is the twenty-first century and either you are with us or you are against us. Where is your flag?” She references an America whose hand is at the throat of the black man, under “Bush who can’t remember if two or three people were convicted for dragging a black man to his death in his home state of Texas…You don’t remember because you don’t care.”

She concludes her collection with meditations on poetry and its place in a new twenty-first century America:
	
> Or Paul Celan said that the poem was no different /  
> from a handshake. I cannot see any basic difference / 
> between a handshake and a poem—is how Rosemary / 

> Waldrop translated his German. The handshake is our /  
> decided ritual of both asserting (I am here) and hand- /  
> ing over (here) a self to another. Hence the poem is /  
> that—Here. I am here. This conflation of the solidarity of /  
> presence with the offering of this same presence per- /  
> haps has everything to do with being alive.

The unfastened quality of form, the informal quality of tone, and the invaluable aid of image are the tools through which she establishes her reaction to the America affected by the dawn of the twenty-first century; she is reacting to a world that cultivates emptiness and nihilism through over-medication, death, injustice, and illness. Rankine invites the reader, through the gentleness of her form, to see and feel alongside her, where “in order for something to be handed over a hand must extend and a hand must receive. We must both be here in this world in this life in this place indicating the presence of.”
