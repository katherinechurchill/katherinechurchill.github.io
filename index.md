“I am an hourglass,” he writes, in a form that tightens as it slides down the page “most of me before	some after	almost none	in the narrow	now.” In his first collection of poetry, The Catalog of Broken Things, A. Molotkov, a Russian-born poet, musician, novelist, takes the reader for a surrealistic walk along the inside of a self-driven narrative. 

Molotkov abandons the framing power of the title and the tight formalism of structured poetic forms in favor of something looser; to be contained within a form is to be contained within a structure that doesn’t allow for the way that he communicates action, emotion, and character. Parts One and Three follow a loose poetic form that often mimics the rhythm of sounds and the image of shapes. Parts Two and Four run on prose forms that parallel each other; the simultaneous structure and looseness of the form allows Molotkov to intersperse the text with a form that visually widens and recedes:   

> In the final experiment, I’m the rabbit, and  
> you, the wheat field. I press my haunches  
> into your fertile soil, each leap eternal.  
> you are tender under me. You make many  
> sounds. The air smells of grass. Then you  
> are the eagle, your swoop smooth and  
> elegant, like a long parenthesis. I’m still  
> the rabbit.  

>  We study ourselves  
>  under bright lights.
	
The subject of the poem suggests surprise, anger, a reaction—but the speaker doesn’t give in, and calmly decides that the circular roll of nature, of life, will continue. This seems to be the message of Part Two, strangely named “The Protagonist’s True Story.” Mostly written in the first person, these poems reveal the character of the speaker—but the poem also switches into a half-baked third-person omniscient point of view. It’s difficult to distinguish the purpose of the switch. The message is beautiful, certainly; however, the reader doesn’t become entrenched in this beauty, as they might want to, but becomes rather distracted by the cyclical nature of the form: this catalogue of images adds up to something, but what? The answer is not easily answerable, it seems, even in the looseness that prose form allows.

Part Four, titled “Your Life As It Is,” is weak for the same reasons as Part Two. It’s a collection of dreams written down in the hours of the early morning; every one begins with the opening line “you wake up in the morning,” and every one ends with the final stanza’s first line “you go outside.” The consistency of form is cohesive, though in reaching for a surrealistic style—trying to connect dream-experience with reality—Molotkov is caught in the same trap he fell into thirty-two pages earlier. The reader is again caught in a loop of the same message over and over, and no meaning is given to the repetition. To strengthen the message, maybe; perhaps to break the reader’s expectations of surrealism down into pieces—no obvious intention or method is discernable. 

The most cohesive part of the collection is the eponymous Part One, “The Catalog of Broken Things.” It’s an assemblage of portrait poems for different members of the speaker’s family. Mother, father, wife, husband, daughter, sister, aunt, and mother again are characterized through their relationship to the speaker. Consistent symbols of marble blocks, suns, wings, nets, and the sun and moon are used in parallel through different poems across the collection. A tender love poem, 2, characterizes the wife and the love between the two characters simultaneously:

> She undefines me, 
> sends me looking for myself
> in new place.

> I invite exile, love 
> invasion, mourn
> her in advance.

The speaker processes death from a young perspective in 8: “My grandmother is not / herself. / She has a room of dark fabric,” and punctuates this process by mimicking the rhythm of footsteps, “we listen for her / footsteps / when we can’t fall / asleep.” The focus on maternal figureheads rounds out the collection with a second poem about the speaker’s mother with a harshness that counterbalances the empathy of the first poem: 
 
> She knows suns  
> and moons fail in the end. Boats  
> sink, rot. Marble  
> crumbles. And now, I  
> know it too, I’m used to this  
> exit of others, this betrayal  
> of permanence.

If you’re looking for something life altering, The Catalog of Broken Things is not for you. Although he misses the mark in his use of surrealism, Molotkov invites the reader to see and feel alongside the speaker, where “veins have no traffic lights, no stop signs. Blood laughs at high speeds. Life boils our white cells, runs from the scene of the accident. We are the eggs of our future selves.”
